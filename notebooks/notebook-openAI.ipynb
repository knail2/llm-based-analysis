      "#### Multi-Panel Interviews\n",
      "1. **Question:** Why do you want to be a doctor?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** I have always been passionate about science and helping others. My experiences volunteering at hospitals have shown me the impact that healthcare professionals can have on patients' lives. I believe that becoming a doctor will allow me to combine my interests and make a meaningful difference in people's health and well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Question:** What are your strengths and weaknesses?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** One of my strengths is my ability to empathize with others, which enables me to connect with patients and understand their needs.

      "\n",
      "3. **Question:** Describe a challenging situation you faced and how you handled it.\n",
      "   - **Answer:** During my internship at a healthcare facility, I encountered a situation where a patient was non-compliant with their treatment plan. I took the time to communicate with them, understand their concerns, and collaborated with the healthcare team to modify the plan. This approach improved the patient's adherence and trust in the medical team.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Group Interviews\n",
      "1. **Question:** How would you handle a disagreement with a teammate during a group project?\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Question:** What role do you typically take in team settings?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** I often take on the role of a facilitator, ensuring that everyone has a chance to share their ideas and that the group stays focused on our goals. I believe that every person's contribution is valuable, and fostering an inclusive environment leads to better results.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Group Activities\n",
      "1. **Question:** In a group setting, how do you ensure that everyone participates?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** I encourage participation by directly asking quieter group members for their opinions and ensuring that the discussion is balanced. I also create an atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts without fear of judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Question:** How would you prioritize tasks during a group project with a tight deadline?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** I would first assess the project requirements and identify the most critical tasks. Then, I would delegate responsibilities based on each member's strengths and availability. Regular check-ins would help keep the team on track and adjust priorities as needed.\n",

      "#### Question 1: Can you tell us about a time when you faced a challenge in a team setting?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**\n",
      "\"During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a group project for a biology course that required us to present our findings on a complex topic.

I realized that the intention behind the criticism was to help me improve. I actively worked on incorporating their suggestions, such as practicing my communication skills with colleagues and role-playing patient interactions.\n",
      "\n",

      "Final Answer: \n",
      "- **Question 1:** Can you tell us about a time when you faced a challenge in a team setting?  \n",
      "  **Answer:** \"During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a group project for a biology course that required us to present our findings on a complex topic. Initially, I felt overwhelmed because I am naturally reserved and find it difficult to voice my opinions in group settings. However, I realized that my strong analytical skills could contribute significantly to our project. I decided to take a step back and listen to my teammates’ ideas first. This gave me a clearer understanding of their perspectives and allowed me to identify gaps in our research. I compiled the information we had and proposed a structured outline for our presentation. By focusing on collaboration, I encouraged my team members to share their insights, which made everyone feel included and valued. In the end, our presentation was well-received, and I learned the importance of utilizing my strengths while also adapting my communication style to work effectively with others. This experience taught me that being introverted doesn’t mean I can’t contribute; it just means I may approach collaboration differently.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Question 2:** How do you handle criticism, especially in a high-pressure environment?  \n",
      "  **Answer:** \"I understand that criticism, especially in a medical context, is a vital part of learning and growth. During my internship at a local clinic, I received feedback on my patient interaction skills. Initially, I found it difficult to accept, as I tend to internalize comments due to my introverted nature. However, I took a moment to reflect on the feedback and sought clarification from my supervisor. This helped me see the situation from a different perspective. I realized that the intention behind the criticism was to help me improve. I actively worked on incorporating their suggestions, such as practicing my communication skills with colleagues and role-playing patient interactions. Over time, I became more confident and learned to view criticism as an opportunity for development rather than a setback. This experience has taught me resilience and the importance of seeking help when needed, which I believe are crucial attributes for a future medical professional.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Question 3:** Why do you want to pursue a career in medicine?  \n",
      "  **Answer:** \"My desire to pursue a career in medicine stems from a deep-rooted passion for helping others and a fascination with the human body and how it functions. Growing up, I often found myself drawn to science, and I excelled in subjects like biology and chemistry. My interest in medicine intensified when I volunteered at a hospital during high school, where I observed how healthcare professionals made a profound difference in patients’ lives. As a shy individual, I have always appreciated the power of listening and empathy. I believe that these qualities are essential in medicine, as they allow for a deeper understanding of patients’ needs. I want to combine my analytical skills and compassionate nature to provide holistic care. My goal is to contribute to a patient-centered approach in healthcare, where every individual feels heard and respected.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Question 4:** How do you envision contributing to a diverse team in medical school?  \n",
      "  **Answer:** \"I recognize that diversity enhances learning, and I aim to foster an inclusive environment in medical school. While I may be quiet, I believe that my thoughtful contributions can add value to discussions. I plan to actively listen to my peers and encourage quieter voices to share their perspectives as well. Additionally, I have experience working with diverse groups through community service projects, where I collaborated with individuals from various backgrounds. I learned that effective communication is key to understanding differing viewpoints. In medical school, I would initiate study groups that respect each member’s learning style, ensuring everyone feels comfortable sharing their insights. My goal is to create a supportive atmosphere that values empathy and collaboration, which are crucial in the medical field. I believe that by embracing our differences, we can better prepare ourselves to serve a diverse patient population.\"  \n",
